I messed-up the initial .git folder with all the history. But I could recover the commits I made (at least most of them) from the console.

given a player with an empty board he wins
given a player and a board one by one, the player wins
given a player and a one by two board we cannot determin winner because of draw
extracted the getWinner(..) method
given a player and two by one board there is always a draw
given any number of players and a one by three board it will be a draw
Extracted getDraw() method
Extracted Game class
Created GameTests class
Renamed the Game methods
